Pass 0: Load the whole program into memory
- Make sure exactly one unit with a `main` declartion is loaded

Pass 1: Basic sanity checks
- Disallow cyclic dependencies
- Import/export checks
    - For each import clause with explicit names, import name list is cross-referenced with the associated unit to check all explicitly imported named are actually defined
    - Likewise, each export clause is cross-reference with the decls of the owning unit to make sure it defines all exported names
    - Make sure that each imported name, even if it exists in the referenced module, is explicitly exported
    - Disallow duplicates in imported and exported name lists
    - Warn if an import alias is defined twice (one overshadows the other)
    - Warn if an explicitly imported name is defined twice (one overshadows the other)
- Find unbound names in types
- Find unbound names in terms
- Adhoc checks
    - In every modify instance, every type variable in the context should appear in the head
    - In every modify instance, every head should be a type constructor applied to type variables

Pass 2: Adhoc instance gathering
- Also check whether any instances overlap and report those errors here

Pass 3: Desugaring
- Eliminate some possible word forms by performing desugaring

Pass 4: Demodularization
- All names referenced from an imported module, aliased and included locally, will be given their full explicit module path
- The program can then be flattened into declarations alone

Pass 5: Kind annotate
- Explicitly annotate all known type variables (adhocs, overloads, nouns, checks) with the inferred kind

Pass 6: Type annotate
- Explicitly annotate all term variables and decls with their inferred types

Pass 7: Dictionary passing translation
- Generates core typed boba, which has an untypd semantics

Pass 8: Monomorphize fixed-size verbs/nouns
- Should have no more fixed size types after this
- Can we push this phase up earlier? Treat it like a macro expand? More code to typecheck...

Pass 9: Monomorphize the rest
- Should have no more polymorphism after this

Pass 10: Generate computed goto C
- Placehold for something more reasonable
