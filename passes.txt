Pass 0: Load the whole program into memory
- Make sure only one unit with a `main` declartion is loaded

Pass 1: Import/export name-list check
- For each import clause with explicit names, import name list is cross-referenced with the associated unit to check all explicitly imported named are actually defined
- Likewise, each export clause is cross-reference with the decls of the owning unit to make sure it defines all exported names

Pass 2: Adverb predicate checks
- In every modify instance, every type variable in the context should appear in the head
- In every modify instance, every head should be a type constructor applied to type variables

Pass 3: Simplify types
- Convert from the grammar form of types into type applications, sequences, and rows

Pass 4: Adverb instance gathering
- Also check whether any instances overlap and report those errors here

Pass 5: Simplify terms
- Eliminate some possible word forms by performing desugaring

Pass 6: Demodularization
- All names referenced from an imported module, aliased and included locally, will be given their full explicit module path
- The program can then be flattened into declarations alone

Pass 7: Kind annotate
- Explicitly annotate all known type variables (adhocs, modifies, nouns) with the inferred kind

Pass 8: Type annotate
- Explicitly annotate all term variables and decls with their inferred types

Pass 9: Dictionary passing translation
- Generates core typed boba, which has an untypd semantics

Pass 10: Generate assembly
- Placehold for something more reasonable
